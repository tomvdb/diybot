# About 
diybot is a personal robot that can be 3d printed. The goal is to create a robot character that can run around, a robot that looks cool and also has a way to portray emotion in a theatrical manner

# Current Status
The basic 3d design is finished and can be printed. We are currently working on the electronics and programming. 

Consider this project in "BETA" - Anything can and probably will change ;)

# Design
diybot was designed in Fusion 360. You can find the original source here to make your own modifications to it: http://a360.co/2xKfoKy

# Printing
Our current test print has been printed in pla using CCTREE filament. Most of the parts can be printed at  20% infill. We recommend printing the pieces that connect to servo's to be printed at higher infill for strength.
